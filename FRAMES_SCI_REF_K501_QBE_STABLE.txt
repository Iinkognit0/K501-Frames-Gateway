ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This publication defines FRAMES as a timeless canonical archive for the
stable representation of knowledge and life states. FRAMES is neither a
narrative system nor an interpretative framework. It is a reference
architecture designed to preserve reconstructible states without overwrite,
reset, or semantic drift.

The archive operates under strict append-only constraints. Once a state is
recorded, it remains invariant. FRAMES asserts no truth claims, authority, or
evaluative hierarchy. Its sole function is to provide a deterministic
reference space in which states may be held, compared, and reconstructed
over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Contemporary information systems are increasingly affected by instability
arising from revision cycles, narrative reinterpretation, and semantic drift.
These mechanisms undermine long-term reconstructibility and weaken the
reliability of archived states.

FRAMES addresses this condition by formalizing a canonical archive in which
states are preserved as immutable references once recorded. The system
introduces no teleology, optimization goal, or progression model. It
establishes only the minimal structural conditions required for stability and
long-term reference integrity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. TERMINOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

All terminology used herein is strictly functional and non-metaphysical.

- "Canonical" denotes structural consistency and referential stability.
  It does not imply authority, correctness, or normativity.
- "Archive" denotes a preservation-oriented reference space.
- "Quantum" denotes state completeness and non-divisibility only.

No symbolic, metaphysical, or speculative interpretation is supported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. APPEND-ONLY STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

FRAMES enforces a strict append-only policy.

Let S = { s0, s1, s2, ... } be the ordered set of recorded states.

For all indices i < j, state si remains invariant with respect to sj.

States cannot be modified, removed, reinterpreted, or overridden.
New states may only be added as distinct entries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUANTUM-STRUCTURED STATE DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Each recorded state is represented as a quantum-structured unit.

A quantum-structured state satisfies:

1. Completeness
2. Non-Divisibility
3. Invariance
4. Context Independence

Quantum structure is a representational constraint,
not a claim about the nature of reality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. STABILIZATION CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Stabilization is not achieved by recursive duplication.

Formally:
Stabilization != <F1, F2, F3, F4>^2

Stabilization is achieved if and only if:
Stabilization = ReEntry(S) AND Invariant(S)

- ReEntry(S): recorded states re-enter the system as reference input
- Invariant(S): core reference conditions remain unchanged over time

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

FRAMES does not:
- compute
- evaluate
- predict
- guide behavior
- assert truth

Any such use constitutes a category error.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. FREEZE DECLARATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This document is frozen.

No extension, modification, reinterpretation, or narrative expansion is
permitted within its scope. Any future material must be appended as a
separate, time-anchored reference state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

FRAMES defines a timeless canonical archive for the stable representation of
states. Through append-only ordering and quantum-structured completeness,
the system ensures long-term reconstructibility without semantic drift.

This publication explains nothing, decides nothing, and proves nothing.
It holds.
