Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 6 — PackBlocks and Aggregation without Semantics

This chapter formalizes how multiple Frames are grouped for transport and verification without introducing meaning or execution.

⸻

6.1 Motivation for PackBlocks

Individual Frames are atomic and append-only.
However, archival systems require transportable units.

A PackBlock is such a unit:
	•	it aggregates Frames,
	•	it preserves order,
	•	it does not alter or interpret content.

PackBlocks exist for logistics, not logic.

⸻

6.2 Formal Definition

Let \mathcal{F} = \{F_1, F_2, \dots, F_n\} be an ordered Frame sequence.

A PackBlock P is defined as:
P = \langle F_1 \Vert F_2 \Vert \dots \Vert F_n \rangle

where \Vert denotes concatenation, not computation.

⸻

6.3 Append-Only Constraint

Once created, a PackBlock is immutable.

To add new Frames:
	•	a new PackBlock must be created,
	•	or an existing PackBlock must be superseded, never modified.

Formally:
P_k \nrightarrow P_k'
\quad\text{(no in-place mutation)}

⸻

6.4 Pack-Level Hashing

A PackBlock may carry a checksum:
h_P = H(P)

This hash:
	•	verifies transport integrity,
	•	does not replace Frame-level hashes,
	•	does not introduce hierarchy.

Object-hashes and Pack-hashes are strictly separated.

⸻

6.5 PackBlocks vs. Containers

A PackBlock is not:
	•	an execution container,
	•	a transaction,
	•	a semantic bundle.

It is:
	•	offline,
	•	linear,
	•	verifiable.

No PackBlock may contain instructions.

⸻

6.6 Relationship to Index Layers

PackBlocks integrate with indices as follows:
	•	L0 may list PackBlocks as opaque objects.
	•	L1 may reference PackBlock checksums.
	•	No index infers meaning from packing.

⸻

6.7 Proof Boundary Preservation

Aggregation does not strengthen or weaken proofs.

If a Frame is unverifiable alone,
it remains unverifiable inside a PackBlock.

This preserves the axiom:

Aggregation never creates truth.
