Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 8 — Canonical Serialization and Deterministic Hashing

This chapter specifies how QAL guarantees that identical artifacts yield identical hashes across time, platforms, and tools.

⸻

8.1 Motivation

Deterministic verification requires that the same logical artifact always maps to the same byte sequence before hashing.
Without canonical serialization, hashes become environment-dependent and unverifiable.

⸻

8.2 Canonical Serialization Principle

Let A be a structured artifact.
Canonical serialization is a total function:

\mathrm{SER}: A \rightarrow B

where B is a byte sequence such that:
	•	\mathrm{SER}(A) is unique,
	•	\mathrm{SER}(A) is platform-independent,
	•	\mathrm{SER}(A) is order-stable.

⸻

8.3 Deterministic Hash Function

Given a cryptographic hash function H:

h = H(\mathrm{SER}(A))

Determinism holds iff:
\forall A_1, A_2:\ A_1 \equiv A_2 \Rightarrow H(\mathrm{SER}(A_1)) = H(\mathrm{SER}(A_2))

⸻

8.4 Serialization Constraints

QAL mandates the following constraints for \mathrm{SER}:
	•	Fixed key ordering.
	•	Explicit encoding (UTF-8).
	•	No insignificant whitespace.
	•	No implicit defaults.
	•	Explicit numeric representations.

Any deviation constitutes a new artifact.

⸻

8.5 Hash Scope Discipline

Hashes bind structure only, never interpretation.

Formally:
H : \text{Structure} \rightarrow \text{Digest}

Semantic meaning is excluded from the hash domain by design.

⸻

8.6 Stability Under Reproduction

Canonical serialization guarantees:
	•	Cross-system reproducibility.
	•	Long-term auditability.
	•	Offline verification.

No trusted execution environment is required.

⸻

8.7 Serialization as Proof Boundary

Canonical serialization defines the outer boundary of proof.

Beyond this boundary:
	•	interpretation begins,
	•	proof ends.

This boundary is strict and non-negotiable.
