Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 10 — Minimal Completeness Conditions

This chapter defines the minimal formal conditions under which a QAL artifact is considered complete, i.e. admissible for verification, audit, and long-term archival.

⸻

10.1 Definition of Completeness

An artifact A is minimally complete iff all required structural components are present and well-formed.

Formally:

\mathrm{COMPLETE}(A) \iff \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} C_i(A)

where each C_i is a mandatory condition.

⸻

10.2 Mandatory Structural Components

A QAL artifact MUST include:
	1.	Type declaration
	2.	Canonicalization version identifier
	3.	Time anchor (UTC + Unix Epoch)
	4.	Canonical serialization
	5.	Cryptographic hash of the canonical form

Absence of any component implies incompleteness.

⸻

10.3 Time Anchor Condition

Each artifact MUST include a time anchor:

T = (\mathrm{UTC}, \mathrm{Epoch})

The time anchor establishes ordering, not truth.

Artifacts without a time anchor are unverifiable in sequence.

⸻

10.4 Canonical Serialization Condition

A canonical serialization \mathrm{SER}_v(A) MUST exist and be deterministic:

\forall A: \mathrm{SER}_v(A) = \mathrm{SER}_v(A)

under identical inputs.

Non-determinism invalidates completeness.

⸻

10.5 Hash Condition

A cryptographic hash H MUST be computed over the canonical serialization:

H = \mathrm{HASH}(\mathrm{SER}_v(A))

The hash is the identity of the artifact, not its meaning.

⸻

10.6 Minimality Principle

No additional semantics are required for completeness.

Completeness ≠ correctness
Completeness ≠ truth
Completeness = structural sufficiency

⸻

10.7 Failure Modes

An artifact is incomplete if:
	•	a required field is missing,
	•	serialization is ambiguous,
	•	hash cannot be reproduced,
	•	version binding is absent.

Incomplete artifacts MUST NOT be canonized.

⸻

10.8 Scientific Implication

Minimal completeness enables:
	•	automated verification,
	•	independent reproduction,
	•	long-term archival stability.

It is the lowest threshold at which scientific handling becomes possible.
