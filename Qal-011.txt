Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 11 — Stability Under Extension (Monotonicity)

This chapter formalizes the requirement that QAL systems remain stable when extended. Extensions must preserve all previously established structure, order, and verifiability.

⸻

11.1 Monotonic Extension Principle

Let A be a complete QAL artifact and A' an extension of A.

A \preceq A'

denotes that A' extends A monotonically.

Monotonicity requires that no existing component of A is altered or invalidated in A'.

⸻

11.2 Append-Only Constraint

All extensions MUST be append-only.

Formally, if A is represented as an ordered sequence:

A = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)

then any extension satisfies:

A' = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, a_{n+1}, \dots, a_{n+m})

for m \ge 1.

Deletion or modification of any a_i with i \le n is forbidden.

⸻

11.3 Preservation of Identity

For every artifact a_i \in A:

\mathrm{HASH}(a_i)_{A'} = \mathrm{HASH}(a_i)_A

Identity is invariant under extension.

⸻

11.4 Ordering Stability

The relative order of existing artifacts MUST remain unchanged.

If:

a_i \prec a_j \quad \text{in } A

then:

a_i \prec a_j \quad \text{in } A'

for all valid extensions.

⸻

11.5 Time Anchor Compatibility

New artifacts MAY introduce new time anchors, but MUST NOT contradict existing ones.

Let T_i and T_j be time anchors with i < j:

T_i.\mathrm{epoch} \le T_j.\mathrm{epoch}

Violations break monotonicity.

⸻

11.6 Canonical Serialization Invariance

The canonical serialization of all pre-existing artifacts MUST remain byte-identical after extension.

Re-serialization of historical artifacts is not permitted.

⸻

11.7 Proof Chain Extension

Proof chains MAY be extended but never rewritten.

Let H_n be the terminal hash of A.
Then A' MUST reference H_n as its predecessor:

\mathrm{prev}(A') = H_n

⸻

11.8 Scientific Implication

Monotonicity guarantees:
	•	historical integrity,
	•	reproducible audits,
	•	immunity to retroactive reinterpretation.

It enables long-lived scientific archives without trust assumptions.
