Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 12 — Canonical Serialization Selection Criteria

This chapter defines the formal criteria by which a canonical serialization method is selected for QAL. The goal is deterministic identity, auditability, and long-term stability across systems and time.

⸻

12.1 Determinism Requirement

A serialization method MUST be deterministic.

For any artifact A:

\mathrm{SER}(A) = \mathrm{SER}(A)

across:
	•	platforms,
	•	programming languages,
	•	runtime environments,
	•	time.

No entropy, locale, or implementation-specific variance is permitted.

⸻

12.2 Byte-Level Stability

Canonical serialization is evaluated at the byte level.

Let B(A) be the byte sequence produced by serialization.

B(A) \equiv B'(A) \;\; \forall\; \text{valid implementations}

Whitespace, ordering, encoding, and numeric representation MUST be fixed.

⸻

12.3 Encoding Constraint

The serialization encoding MUST be explicitly defined and immutable.

Allowed:
	•	UTF-8 (no BOM) for textual forms.
	•	Fixed-width binary encoding for binary forms.

Implicit encoding assumptions are forbidden.

⸻

12.4 Structural Completeness

Serialization MUST include all structurally relevant components of an artifact.

Let A = (H, P) with header H and payload P:

\mathrm{SER}(A) = \mathrm{SER}(H) \,\Vert\, \mathrm{SER}(P)

Partial serialization invalidates identity and proofs.

⸻

12.5 Order Canonicalization

All unordered structures MUST be canonically ordered prior to serialization.

Examples:
	•	Map keys sorted lexicographically.
	•	Sets serialized as ordered lists.
	•	Numeric normalization (no alternate forms).

Formally, for any unordered collection U:

\mathrm{canon}(U) = \mathrm{sort}(U)

⸻

12.6 Hash Compatibility

Canonical serialization MUST be compatible with cryptographic hashing.

Let H be a cryptographic hash function:

\mathrm{ID}(A) = H(\mathrm{SER}(A))

Any change in \mathrm{SER}(A) MUST imply a different hash.

⸻

12.7 Language and Tool Independence

The method MUST be implementable without privileged tooling.

Requirements:
	•	No proprietary formats.
	•	No hidden state.
	•	No version-dependent behavior.

Reference implementations MAY exist, but are not normative.

⸻

12.8 Longevity Criterion

Serialization MUST be readable and reconstructible decades later.

Disallowed:
	•	Compression without specification.
	•	Context-dependent schemas.
	•	Runtime-generated structure.

Preference is given to simple, fully specified grammars.

⸻

12.9 Scientific Neutrality

Canonical serialization MUST carry no semantics beyond structure.

It encodes what is, not what it means.

Interpretation layers are strictly external to QAL.

⸻

12.10 Selection Outcome

A serialization method is acceptable iff it satisfies all criteria:

\text{Valid}(\mathrm{SER}) \iff \bigwedge_{i=1}^{9} C_i

where C_i are the constraints defined in Sections 12.1–12.9.
