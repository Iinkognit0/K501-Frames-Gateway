Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 13 — Canonicalization Versioning and Freeze Discipline

This chapter formalizes how canonicalization rules are versioned, frozen, and evolved without breaking identity, proofs, or archival integrity.

⸻

13.1 Separation of Artifact and Canonicalization

Canonicalization rules are external to artifacts.

Let:
	•	A be an artifact,
	•	C_v be a canonicalization specification at version v.

Identity is defined as:

\mathrm{ID}(A, v) = H(\mathrm{SER}_{C_v}(A))

A change in C_v does not mutate A; it creates a new identity context.

⸻

13.2 Explicit Version Binding

Every serialized artifact MUST declare the canonicalization version used.

Formally:

A \rightarrow (A, v)

Undeclared or implicit canonicalization versions are invalid.

⸻

13.3 Immutability of Frozen Versions

Once a canonicalization version C_v is frozen:
	•	Its grammar,
	•	ordering rules,
	•	encoding rules,
	•	normalization rules

are immutable.

No patches, errata, or reinterpretations are permitted.

⸻

13.4 Forward Evolution Rule

New canonicalization rules MUST be introduced only as new versions:

C_{v+1} \neq C_v

Backward mutation is forbidden.

Historical artifacts remain bound to their original C_v.

⸻

13.5 Identity Stability Guarantee

For a fixed artifact A and frozen version v:

\forall t_1, t_2:\quad \mathrm{ID}(A, v, t_1) = \mathrm{ID}(A, v, t_2)

Time MUST NOT influence identity.

⸻

13.6 Multi-Version Coexistence

Multiple canonicalization versions MAY coexist.

Verification requires explicit selection:

\text{verify}(A, v)

Cross-version comparison is allowed but non-identical by definition.

⸻

13.7 Freeze Declaration

A freeze event MUST be explicit and recorded.

A valid freeze includes:
	•	version identifier,
	•	timestamp (UTC + Unix Epoch),
	•	cryptographic hash of the canonicalization spec.

After freeze:

\neg \exists \Delta C_v

⸻

13.8 No Silent Upgrades

Automatic or silent upgrades of canonicalization versions are forbidden.

Any migration MUST:
	•	be explicit,
	•	produce a new identity,
	•	preserve the original artifact untouched.

⸻

13.9 Archival Safety Principle

Archives MUST store:
	•	the artifact,
	•	the canonicalization version identifier,
	•	the frozen specification (or a verifiable reference).

Without all three, long-term verification is not guaranteed.

⸻

13.10 Formal Closure

Canonicalization discipline ensures:
	•	identity determinism,
	•	historical verifiability,
	•	future-proof archives,
	•	zero semantic drift.

This closes the canonicalization layer of QAL.
