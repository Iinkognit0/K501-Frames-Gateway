Quantum Archivator Language (QAL)

Chapter 19 — Security Considerations and Threat Model

This chapter defines the security posture of QAL. It is normative with respect to what QAL defends against and what it explicitly does not.

⸻

19.1 Design Philosophy

QAL follows a minimal trust and maximal verifiability principle.

Security is achieved through:
	•	immutability,
	•	canonical serialization,
	•	cryptographic hashing,
	•	strict separation of layers.

QAL does not rely on secrecy, obscurity, or runtime enforcement.

⸻

19.2 Threat Model Overview

QAL assumes an adversary who can:
	•	read all artifacts,
	•	copy, reorder, truncate, or replay data,
	•	inject malformed artifacts,
	•	control storage or transport layers.

QAL does not assume:
	•	trusted execution environments,
	•	trusted clocks,
	•	trusted networks,
	•	trusted identities.

⸻

19.3 Assets to Protect

Asset	Protection Goal
Frame integrity	Detect any modification
Order integrity	Detect reordering or omission
Provenance	Maintain verifiable lineage
Auditability	Enable third-party verification

Confidentiality is out of scope.

⸻

19.4 Integrity Guarantees

Integrity is provided by:
	•	cryptographic hashes over canonical byte sequences,
	•	explicit payload length encoding,
	•	fixed serialization order.

Any single-bit modification yields a detectable hash mismatch.

⸻

19.5 Replay and Duplication

QAL treats replay as non-malicious by default.

Properties:
	•	Replayed frames are byte-identical.
	•	Duplication does not invalidate integrity.
	•	Higher layers may apply deduplication policies.

QAL itself neither prevents nor penalizes replay.

⸻

19.6 Truncation and Partial Data Attacks

Truncation is detected via:
	•	explicit payload length,
	•	missing hash line,
	•	hash mismatch on recomputation.

Partial frames are invalid by definition.

⸻

19.7 Reordering Attacks

QAL frames are individually valid regardless of position.

Order integrity is enforced by:
	•	higher-level blocks,
	•	index frames,
	•	hash-chained aggregation layers.

QAL deliberately separates atomic validity from sequence validity.

⸻

19.8 Hash Collision Considerations

QAL relies on standard cryptographic assumptions:
	•	SHA-256 / SHA3-256 collision resistance.
	•	Preimage resistance.

If a hash function is broken:
	•	existing artifacts remain intact as historical records,
	•	new versions MUST migrate via versioned grammar.

No silent algorithm substitution is permitted.

⸻

19.9 Canonicalization Attacks

Canonicalization is a primary defense surface.

Mitigations:
	•	single, unambiguous grammar,
	•	fixed field order,
	•	fixed encodings,
	•	explicit versioning.

Any alternative rendering invalidates the artifact.

⸻

19.10 Injection and Grammar Abuse

Malformed artifacts are rejected by:
	•	strict grammar parsing,
	•	bounded field sizes,
	•	explicit type constraints.

QAL parsers MUST fail closed.

⸻

19.11 Denial-of-Service Considerations

QAL does not prevent:
	•	large payload submission,
	•	storage exhaustion.

Mitigation is delegated to:
	•	ingestion policies,
	•	quota systems,
	•	external resource management.

QAL itself remains passive.

⸻

19.12 Side-Channel Considerations

QAL provides no timing, behavioral, or execution side channels.

Artifacts are static.
Verification is deterministic.
No conditional behavior exists.

⸻

19.13 Out-of-Scope Threats

QAL explicitly does not address:
	•	confidentiality,
	•	encryption,
	•	authentication,
	•	authorization,
	•	access control,
	•	runtime isolation.

These belong to surrounding systems.

⸻

19.14 Security Invariants

The following invariants MUST always hold:
	1.	Grammar determinism
	2.	Canonical byte identity
	3.	Hash verifiability
	4.	Append-only semantics

Violation of any invariant invalidates trust.

⸻

19.15 Security Posture Summary

QAL is:
	•	transparent,
	•	audit-first,
	•	tamper-evident,
	•	execution-agnostic.

It is designed for truth preservation, not control.

⸻

19.16 Closure

QAL security derives from structure, not enforcement.
Trust emerges from verification, not authority.
