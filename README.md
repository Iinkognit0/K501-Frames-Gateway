# K501 Frames Gateway — File Archive

## Overview

This repository is intentionally minimal.

It serves **primarily as a structured file archive**, not as an active software product, service, or executable system.  
The purpose is long-term preservation, reference stability, and transparent public access to the K501 / Frames materials.

There is **no hidden runtime logic**, no background processing, and no operational claims beyond archival integrity.
